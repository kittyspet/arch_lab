## Introduction
This project is a software architecture model for a conference management system. The system allows users to create, manage, and interact with conferences and their related data. The architecture model is created using Structurizr, a software architecture modeling tool.

## Project Overview
The conference management system consists of a web application and a database layer. The web application is responsible for user interaction and handling API requests. The database layer stores user data, report data, and conference data. The system is designed to be scalable and easy to maintain.
